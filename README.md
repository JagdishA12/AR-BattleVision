# AR-BattleVision
This project leverages computer vision and augmented reality to create a system for battlefield awareness. The model detects, classifies, and measures distances to objects in real-time to enhance situational awareness.

**Capabilities:**

-Detects soldiers in war scenarios.

-Classifies soldiers as friend or enemy based on predefined criteria.

-Measures the distance of detected objects to aid in strategic decision-making.

**Applications:**

-Enhances battlefield intelligence and safety.

-Assists in real-time threat assessment and resource allocation.

-This project demonstrates the integration of advanced object detection, classification, and distance measurement in augmented reality to deliver a practical solution for battlefield scenarios.
